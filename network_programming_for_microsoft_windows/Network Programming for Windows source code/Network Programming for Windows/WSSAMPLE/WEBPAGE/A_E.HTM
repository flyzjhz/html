Sources</H1>

<P>
This is a hypertext version of Appendix E in the text _Windows
Sockets Network Programming_, by Bob Quinn and Dave Shute.
<UL>
<LI><A HREF="#InetSources">Internet Sources</A> 
<LI><A HREF="#Biblography">Bibliography</A> 
</UL>

<P>
This appendix contains recommended information sources of all
types. It's split into two sections: Internet sources and Bibliography.
The Internet sources are newsgroups, mail lists, ftp sites, and
World Wide Web pages. The bibliography contains magazine and journal
articles, textbooks, frequently asked question (FAQ) listings,
and Internet requests for comments (RFCs).<HR>

<H2><A NAME="InetSources">Internet Sources</A></H2>

<P>
This section contains the &quot;dynamic&quot; information sources
available on the Internet:
<UL>
<LI><A HREF="#FTPSites">FTP Sites</A> 
<LI><A HREF="#ListServers">List Servers</A> 
<LI><A HREF="#MailLists">Mail Lists</A> 
<LI><A HREF="#NewsGroups">Newsgroups</A> 
<LI><A HREF="#WebPages">Web Pages</A> 
</UL>

<P>
There are many places where you can get pointers to new sources
of information. The best way to find about them as they appear
is by reading relevant newsgroups and mail lists. FAQs can point
you to them after the fact, and many Internet books have pointers.
<H3><A NAME="URLsAndURIs">URLs and URIs</A></H3>

<P>
To access various resources on the Internet, you need a destination
host, the name of a resource, and an indication of what protocol
to use to access the resource. Meet the universal resource locator
(URL). URLs tell you where to go, what to see, and what to do.
URLs are a subset of universal resource identifiers (URIs), and
Tim Berners-Lee --the father of World Wide Web--describes both
in a pair of draft RFCs available on www.cern.ch, the home of
the World Wide Web. Here we paraphrase from those documents:
<UL>
<LI><I>URI</I>: encodes the names and addresses of objects on
the Internet. They encapsulate a name in any registered namespace,
and label it with the namespace, to produce a member of the universal
set of objects.
<LI><I>URL</I>: encodes the physical addresses of objects that
are retrievable using application protocols already deployed on
the Internet. It is a form of URI that expresses an address that
maps onto a specific access algorithm.
</UL>

<P>
You won't typically use URIs, but you will often use URLs. Here's
a simple high-level description of the <B>URL syntax</B>. The
draft RFC details the complete syntax in Bakus-Naur form, but
here is a simpler description of the URL form in common notation
(<B>{}</B> surround required parameters, <B>[]</B> surround optional
parameters, and other characters are mandatory seperators).
<P>
<B>{service}://{host}[:port]/[path/.../][file name]</B> 
<UL>
<LI><I>service </I>(required field): The service is a standard
service name that indicates the protocol to use; Berners-Lee calls
them &quot;URL schemes.&quot; The standard URL syntax currently
recognizes file, ftp, gopher, and http (Note: &quot;file&quot;
requires local disk access, rather than a network access).
<LI><I>host</I> (required field): The host is the host name or
IP address of the network destination on which to access the service
<LI><I>port</I> (optional field): The port number is not frequently
used, but may be specified if the service is available on a non-standard
port number.
<LI><I>path</I> (optional field): This specifies the path name
to the destination directory on the target host. Note: A path
without a file after it, always ends with a forward slash character
(&quot;/&quot;).
</UL>

<P>
We use URLs throughout the remainder of this appendix to denote
resource locations, where appropriate.<HR>

<H3><A NAME="FTPSites">FTP Sites</A></H3>

<P>
The File Transfer Protocol (FTP) provides the most fundemental
means of transferring files on the Internet. Here is a list of
WinSock-related or networking-related sites you may find helpful.
Almost all network software vendors maintain FTP sites, although
we don't list them here. These sites are worth exploring since
they sometimes have interesting files you would otherwise not
know about.

<H3><A NAME="ListServers">List Servers</A></H3>

<P>
Some e-mail locations have list servers that automatically send
requested information. To send a request, you specify your query
in the &quot;Subject:&quot; field in the message header, or in
the main body of your message, or in a combination of both. Different
list servers and queries require different formats. We describe
the format with each entry below.
<P>
<B>info@lcs.com</B>: subject: &quot;faq&quot; for Windows Sockets
application FAQ
<P>
<B>resolve@cs.widener.edu</B> or <B>dns@grasp.insa-lyon.fr</B>:
subject: &quot;help&quot;, message body: &quot;site <I>domain
name or address</I>&quot;; it mails back the domain name information
(i.e. it provides DNS name resolution via e-mail)
<P>
<B>mail-server@nisc.sri.com</B>: nothing in the subject field;
message body: &quot;send rfcnnnn.txt&quot; to have an RFC text
file sent to you<HR>

<H3><A NAME="MailLists">Mail Lists</A></H3>

<P>
Here are a few mail lists to which you can subscribe. Be sure
to note how to get off the list in case you get tired of the eemail
traffic.
<P>
<B>winnews</B>: Microsoft WinNews Electronic newsletter, created
by Microsoft's Personal Operating System's Division (POSD) to
include the latest announcement and resource pointers for MS Windows.
Currently this is read-only for announcements. To subscribe, mail
to enews@microsoft.nwnet.com with &quot;subscribe winnews&quot;
in the message body.
<P>
<B>winsock-hackers</B>: Not heavily trafficked, but the best place
to expose your WinSock development question to many of the WinSock
heavies. It is well read by most of the WinSock implementors,
so this is the place where many WinSock specification ambiguities
are discussed. Subscribe by mailing to listserv@sunsite.unc.edu
with a subject and body of &quot;subscribe winsock-hackers.&quot;
<P>
<B>winsock-l</B>: Good place for WinSock application users, also
for developers but not many development issues are discussed.
Not as heavily trafficked as the alt.winsock newsgroup, but useful.
To join, mail to list-admin@papa.indstate.edu with nothing in
Subject:, and &quot;subscribe winsock-l&quot; as the (only) textual
body of the message. List members have access to WinSock applications
at ftp://papa.indstate.edu/winsock-l, which is regularly updated.
<HR>

<H3><A NAME="NewsGroups">Newsgroups</A></H3>

<P>
USENET newsgroup access is available from any Internet service
provider. There are interest groups for everything under the sun
including a lot of network-programming related traffic. The rules
of courtesy dictate that you should always refer to the &quot;frequently
asked questions&quot; for answers before you post a question (see
FAQs section in this appendix for more information).
<P>
<B>alt.winsock</B>: deals with everything related to Windows Sockets.
There are occasional messages dealing with programming, but it
tends to stay crowded with messages about the shareware WinSock
implementations and the latest WinSock applications (problems
or praises).
<P>
<B>alt.winsock.programming</B>: a good place to ask questions,
or simply lurk watching for information. There's a manageable
amount of traffic here.
<P>
<B>comp.os.ms-windows.networking.tcp-ip</B>: This is a bit redundant
of alt.winsock, but without the volume of message traffic.
<P>
<B>comp.os.ms-windows.networking.windows</B>: Many people send
the same WinSock-related messages here as well as to alt.winsock
and tcp-ip.
<P>
<B>comp.os.ms-windows.programmer.win32</B>: This deals with generic
Win32 programming questions, but there are some specific to WSOCK32
and others dealing with UNIX-to-Win32 porting issues.<HR>

<H3><A NAME="WebPages">Web Pages</A></H3>

<P>
World Wide Web traffic has surpassed FTP traffic on the Internet.
The web is everywhere, and growing daily. There are countless
useful sites for WinSock-related information, although only a
few specialize in WinSock programming. Many of the FTP sites listed
in the FTP section of this appendix also have web pages. There
are many search engines for finding information anywhere on the
Internet. Here are some pointers you may find helpful.

very informative. It gives the derivation of the terms &quot;big
endian&quot; and &quot;little endian,&quot; which are based on

<DD><I>Byte Magazine</I>, Dec. 1994  Describes how to take advantage
of Windows NT features to write a secure server in a design akin
to a UNIX daemon (i.e., the operating system spawns the service
process when it receives a connection request). Although somewhat
high level, it has many useful pointers.

<DD>This is a short and sweet collection of sensible rules of
thumb for optimizing any application. It uses the optimization
of the BSD USENET news server application as a practical example
of what can be accomplished. It says things like &quot;prepare
for the worst, but optimize for the typical case,&quot; and &quot;buying
in bulk is often cheaper ...the law of diminishing returns does
apply to buying in bulk.&quot; Highly recommended.
