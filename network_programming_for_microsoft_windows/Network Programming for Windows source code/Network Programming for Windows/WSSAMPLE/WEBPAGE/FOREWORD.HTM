This is a hypertext version of the Foreword from Martin Hall for the
book _Windows Sockets Network Programming_, by Bob Quinn and Dave Shute.

<P>
In 1991 it was becoming apparent that Microsoft Windows was going
to play a definitive role in the future of desktop computing.
At the same time, if you listened closely, you could here the
first rumblings of the earth-shaking impact TCP/IP was going to
have on the lives of many people. At the intersection of Microsoft
Windows and TCP/IP, however, lay a problem. All the vendors of
TCP/IP products for PCs had produced different programming interfaces
for their own products. I was one of many programmers  around
the world sitting at my PC late at night telling myself <I>there
must be a better way</I>.
<P>
That &quot;better way&quot; got started at a BOF (&quot;Birds
of a Feather&quot;) session at Interop in October 1991. In a room
containing 30 or so of the brightest minds in the industry, the
idea of creating a single, standard transport interface took shape.
The key criteria were to keep it as close to the existing Berkeley
Sockets API as possible and not to require a shoe horn to use
the interface in a Windows message-based application. It's often
tempting for technical people to want to do a perfect job and
include everything in a technical design. One key decision we
made as a group was to limit what we included in the interface
to what the majority of programmers needed. Combined with the
energy and willingness of competitive vendors to work together,
this laid the foundation for the creation and success of the Windows
Sockets API, or &quot;WinSock&quot; as it has become known.
<P>
Over the next 15 months, many people on the WinSock mailing list
contributed to the development of the preliminary specification.
Several interoperability sessions (WinSockathons) took place,
and the result of this cooperative effort was the Windows Sockets
version 1.1 API specification.
<P>
WinSock lies right at the heart of the explosion of interest in
developing and using communications applications on Microsoft
Windows PCs. The global community of developers who cooperated
to define this programming standard is being joined by other programmers
from all over the world who want to add communications capabilities
to their software applications by using WinSock. In short, WinSock
has become hugely popular and has been badly in need of a great
book. Until now.
<P>
I'm honored to have been asked to write the foreword to this book.
It fills a gaping hole by providing developers with the contextual
framework and information detail needed to develop high-quality
WinSock software. Whether you are new to WinSock or consider yourself
a WinSock expert, you will learn things from this book. Bob and
Dave draw on extensive, solid, pragmatic experience with WinSock.
They give you an illuminating guided tour of what you need to
know to develop robust WinSock-based software. In the same spirit
of pragmatism exhibited by the WinSock Group, Bob and Dave have
empathized with programmers in constructing this book. The first
few chapters provide a solid background and framework within which
to understand the details of WinSock, how it can best be used
and exploited relative to your own programming requirements. For
writing WinSock clients, servers, or intermediary DLL components,
the following chapters are well structured and provide exactly
the right level of detail and accessibility. Finally, as WinSock
continues to thrive and progress, knowing where to go to get yet
more information is important, so the appendices include pointers
to other information sources. 
<P>
Bob Quinn and Dave Shute have been immersed in WinSock since the
beginning. They now it outside in, inside out and probably dream
about it in their sleep. I applaud them for their dreams and their
efforts and wholeheartedly recommend this book.
